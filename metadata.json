Its most common application is to style web pages written in HTML and XHTML. The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). CSS is used by both the authors and readers of web pages to define colours, fonts, layout, and other aspects of document presentation. It is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation. This separation",
